## What Is the Approval Portal?

The Approval Portal is a SharePoint application that helps your team manage business requests and approvals in one place. Instead of sending emails back and forth or chasing people for signatures, you simply submit a request and the system automatically routes it to the right person for approval.

## How It Works — Step by Step

### 1. Submitting a Request

1. Open the Approval Portal page in SharePoint
2. Click the **"New Request"** card (or the **+** icon in the sidebar)
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Title** — A short name for your request (e.g., "New Laptop for Marketing Team")
   - **Request Type** — Choose the category (e.g., Purchase Order, Leave Request, Access Request)
   - **Details** — Add any additional information
4. Click **Submit**

That's it! The system will automatically figure out who needs to approve your request and send it to them.

### 2. Tracking Your Requests

On the **Home** dashboard, you can see:

- **My Open Requests** — All requests you've submitted that are still being processed
- **Recent Activity** — A timeline of the latest actions on your requests
- **Overview Chart** — A visual summary of request statuses

Click on any request to see its full details, including which approval stage it's at and who currently has it.

### 3. Approving Requests (For Approvers)

If you are an approver, the dashboard shows you:

- **Awaiting Approval** — The number of requests waiting for your action

Click on a pending request to open it, then choose one of three options:

| Action | What Happens |
|--------|-------------|
| **Approve** | The request moves to the next approval stage, or is fully approved if this was the last stage |
| **Reject** | The request is declined and the person who submitted it is notified |
| **Request Info** | The request is sent back to the person who submitted it so they can provide more details |

You can also add a **comment** when you approve, reject, or request info — this comment is saved in the audit trail.

### 4. Multi-Stage Approvals

Some requests need approval from more than one person. For example, a purchase order might need:

1. **Manager Approval** → Your direct manager
2. **Finance Approval** → The finance team (only if the amount is above a certain threshold)
3. **Director Approval** → A senior director

The system handles this automatically. When one person approves, it moves to the next stage. If a stage doesn't apply (e.g., the amount is below the threshold), it's automatically skipped.

### 5. Smart Manager Detection

When a request needs your manager's approval, the system will:

1. **First** — Try to find your manager from your SharePoint / Microsoft 365 profile
2. **If not found** — Fall back to the default approver set up by your admin

This means you don't have to manually select your manager — the system figures it out for you.

## Navigation

The sidebar on the left (or bottom bar on mobile) has four buttons:

| Icon | Page | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 🏠 **Home** | Dashboard | Your personal overview with metrics and recent activity |
| ➕ **New** | New Request | The form to submit a new request |
| 🕐 **History** | My Requests | A list of all requests you've submitted |
| ⚙️ **Admin** | Settings | Admin settings (if you have admin access) |

---

## Understanding Request Statuses

Your request will show one of these statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Manager Approval** | Waiting for your manager to approve |
| **Finance Approval** | Waiting for the finance team to approve |
| **Info Requested** | The approver needs more information from you — please update your request |
| **Approved** ✅ | Fully approved — no more action needed |
| **Rejected** ❌ | The request was declined |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Who can see my requests?**
Only you and the people involved in the approval process can see your requests. Other employees cannot view them.

**Q: Can I edit a request after submitting it?**
If an approver has requested more information, you can update your request. Otherwise, submitted requests cannot be edited to maintain a clear audit trail.

**Q: How do I know when my request is approved or rejected?**
Check the **Home** dashboard — the status of your requests is always visible. Your request will show a green "Approved" or red "Rejected" badge.

**Q: What happens if my approver is on leave?**
Your admin can set up **delegations** so that another person can approve requests on behalf of someone who is away.

**Q: Can I cancel a request I've submitted?**
Contact your admin to cancel a submitted request.

**Q: I'm an approver but I don't see any pending requests — what's wrong?**
Make sure the request type is configured in the approval matrix and that you are listed as the approver. Contact your admin if the issue persists.
